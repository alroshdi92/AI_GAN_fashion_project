## ✅ Project Goal

To generate creative and realistic clothing designs by training a GAN model on fashion images such as dresses, shoes, and t-shirts.

## 🧠 What is a GAN?

A **GAN (Generative Adversarial Network)** consists of two parts:

- **Generator** 🧵: Learns to create fake clothing images that look real.
- **Discriminator** 🕵️‍♀️: Learns to distinguish between real and fake images.

They play a game where the generator tries to fool the discriminator, and the discriminator tries not to be fooled.
